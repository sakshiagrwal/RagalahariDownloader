### Notes

- The default number of images to download is 10, but you can specify a different number.
- The file name format should include `%d` to indicate where the image numbers go. For example, if the image files are named `image-1.jpg`, `image-2.jpg` etc. the file name format should be `image-%d.jpg`.
- If a file already exists in the target folder, the script will skip downloading that file and move on to the next file
